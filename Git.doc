# This is the scenario:
git reset HEAD^ --soft
git rm .env --cached
git commit --amend

git checkout master index.html


#Undo a commit
There are times when you've committed your changes incorrectly and you want to undo this commit. Sometimes, you may have even pushed the changes to a remote branch. How do you undo or delete this commit? Let's start with undoing a local commit.

git reset --soft HEAD~1
git reset --hard HEAD~1


How to undo a remote commit
There are times you want to undo a commit you have pushed to a remote repository. You can use git revert to undo it locally and push this change to the remote branch.
First, get the commit hash using git reflog.


Log in pretty format
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"

$ git show -s --format='%an, %ae' cbfa2f5
